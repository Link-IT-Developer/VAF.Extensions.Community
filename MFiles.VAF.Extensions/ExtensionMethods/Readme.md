# Extension methods

Much of the functionality within the extensions library is based around the use of .NET extension methods.  These extension methods can be used to add functionality to M-Files API objects without the need for additional classes or data structures.

To use these methods ensure that you import the `MFiles.VAF.Extensions` namespace:

```csharp
using MFiles.VAF.Extensions;
```
